<H3>COOKING</H3>
<h2>“Real cooking is more about following your heart than following recipes.”</h2>
<p>Cooking is as old as civilization itself, and observers have perceived it as both an art and a science. Its history sheds light on the very origins of human settlement, and its variety and traditions reflect unique social, cultural, and environmental influences.</p>

<H3>Painting</H3>
<h2>“I love to look at art, I love to look at paintings, and I almost feel like the experience isn’t complete until I’ve made something of my own.”</h2>
<p>Painting, the expression of ideas and emotions, with the creation of certain aesthetic qualities, in a two-dimensional visual language. The elements of this language—its shapes, lines, colours, tones, and textures—are used in various ways to produce sensations of volume, space, movement, and light on a flat surface.</p>
